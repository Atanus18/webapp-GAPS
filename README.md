**Make a WebApp using Google Apps Script: User can filter the data set Table**


I have made a WebApp using google apps script, from which user can see their task/job in WebApp. 

The data/information present in "Sheet1" in google sheet and the code are in Google Apps Script which help to make WebApp.

    "Sheet1" Column E has URL links. Using google apps script it can be shown as "Click Me" where user can click it and complete the task.
    After completing task the row will not be shown to user.
    
User can filter the data table by date as well as steps. 

In PNG image, viewer can experience the what actually user can see.
